# Shark-Tank

I have done this task using python Django web framework. After creating the models for each entity,then I seeded the given data into sqlite database using python script and applied the Rest framework for view making into an API. I passed the data to url with help of ajax call in frontend and also checked in Postman application.

### Technologies used:
